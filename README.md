Q2 Client-Side Coding Languages

Given that people require programs that help them for different types of tasks, either from the most normal things like checking email, watching videos on the web, or finding information, and that is why the Client-Side model exists.
This has the main characteristic of facilitating the handling of information for anyone, since it depends more on the program that the user manipulates than on its possible dependence on one or more servers. 
Additionally, when the user requests information, it is generally done through an HTML file, which is sent to the server for it to process the request. 
This generates a firm connection with the client and the server in a simple way for the user to use.
Some languages that fit into this category are: JavaScript, VBScript, AJAX and jQuery.
