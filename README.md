Q2 Client-Side Coding Languages

-Given that people require programs that help them for different types of tasks, either from the most normal things like checking your email, watching videos on the web, to accesing to the data stored in a cloud, that is why the Client-Side model exists.

-This has the main characteristic of easing the handling of information for anyone, since it depends more on the program that the user manipulates than on its possible dependence on one or more servers.

-Additionally, when the user requests information, it is generally done through an HTML file, which is sent to the server for it to process the request, and sends the required information to the user.

-This generates a firm connection with the client and the server in a simple way for the user because it handles the information in a more efficient way, distributing the processes the server and the program should do.

-Some languages that fit into this category are JavaScript, VBScript, AJAX and jQuery.
